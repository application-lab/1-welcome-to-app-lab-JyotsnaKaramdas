# About Me
	My name is Jyotsna Karamdas. I am currently a sophomore at NYU Shanghai. I am originally from Connecticut. I plan to major in either Data Science or Computer Science, still undecided. In my free time, I enjoy playing the harmonium (a north Indian classical instrument), learning new programming languages and watching movies. 
    
    The first language that I was introduced to was Python, and I enjoy spending time improving my Python abilities, and now hopefully the same with JavaScript, HTML, etc. 
	
    I want to be able to learn as many programming languages as I possibly can in my time at NYUSH, and I am excited to see where this will take me.
